# Efficient Supply Allocation Solution

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that tackles the problem of **Efficient Supply Allocation** in a ride-hailing marketplace. The task involves building a data-driven solution to guide drivers towards areas with higher expected demand at specific times and locations, ensuring an efficient match between supply (drivers) and demand (riders).

## Problem Statement

A successful ride-hailing platform requires efficient real-time matching of riders (demand) and drivers (supply). Key challenges include:
- Ensuring riders can always get a ride.
- Providing drivers with stable earnings.

This project aims to:
1. **Explore the data** and suggest a solution for guiding drivers towards areas with higher expected demand.
2. **Build and document a baseline model** for the solution.
3. **Describe model design and deployment** strategies.
4. **Explain communication of model recommendations** to drivers.
5. **Design and describe experiments** to validate the solution in live operations while considering marketplace specifics.

## Dataset

The synthetic dataset represents ride demand in the city of Tallinn and consists of approximately 630,000 rows. Key features include:

| Column Name    | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `start_time`   | Time when the order was made                         |
| `start_lat`    | Latitude of the order's pick-up point                |
| `start_lng`    | Longitude of the order's pick-up point               |
| `end_lat`      | Latitude of the order's destination point            |
| `end_lng`      | Longitude of the order's destination point           |
| `ride_value`   | Monetary value of the particular ride                |

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Loading and preprocessing the data.
   - Visualizing demand patterns over time and across locations.

2. **Baseline Model Development**  
   - Building a model to predict areas of high demand using historical data.
   - Documenting model assumptions and methodology.

3. **Solution Deployment Design**  
   - Strategies for integrating the model into real-time systems.
   - Designing APIs or notifications to guide drivers effectively.

4. **Driver Recommendation Communication**  
   - Describing user-friendly interfaces (e.g., app notifications, heatmaps).
   - Explaining how recommendations ensure optimal driver placement.

5. **Experimental Design**  
   - Designing A/B tests to validate the solution in live operations.
   - Considering metrics like ride acceptance rate, driver earnings, and rider wait times.
